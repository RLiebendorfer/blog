Let's prepare in advance for the mushrooms season.

This is the most naive way to evaluate a model. It has a lot of disadvantages. For example it does not pay attention to the proportion of the classes in the test data. However because of its simplicity it can be used for illustration purposes.

### Artificial neural network

### k Nearest Neighbours

Now let's compare our neural network with another model, for example with k nearest neighbours.

### Summary

Next time when I will go to a forest, I will test the model on the real data. It does not work in 100% of cases. However, that is natural: if there is a model that covers 100% cases, it is a sign that most likely something went wrong.
