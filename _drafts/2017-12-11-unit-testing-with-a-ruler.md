You can assess quality of unit tests by the shape of the test methods. You don't even need to read them.

Good unit tests consist of methods which _width is bigger that their height_. That's it.

Example 1: good, 14x4 cm
Example 2: bad, 14x28 cm

This rule can be extrapolated from test methods to methods in general. And even to classes.
