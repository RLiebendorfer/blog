## Pros

### People

Difficult to judge about people without scientific research, I am going to rely on my personal sensation here.

It seems to me that people here are very direct. If they like what you are doing they tell it right away. If they do not like, they critisize directly. I like this approach.

### Ecology And Crime

The air is clean. It is especially noticeable when I go to Saint Petersburg for weekend and then return back. It is not only my subjective feeling, [the numbers](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Estonia&country2=Russia&city1=Tallinn&city2=Saint+Petersburg) say the same.

The town is green. A lot of parks inside the town, while the town itself is surrounded by forests. You easily can see a hare hiding in a bushes, or even foxes or deers.

### IT World

Estonia built quite attractive conditions for IT companies. Due to a high number of the IT companies, the demand for software developers is also high. The developers currently available on the labor market cannot fulfil the demand. As a result, the salaries are high, the number of options is big, the potential employers are open to communication if you want to agree on better conditions for yourself.

### To Summarize

Next time let's discuss the downsides of Tallinn.
