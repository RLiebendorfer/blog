There is a number of ways how someone can steal your money. He can just pick up your wallet. This is the most dangerous way: who knows what martial arts do you possess and how fast do you run. Alternatively, he can silently pull the wallet out of your pocket. Still dangerous because you can notice this. Or (and this is the most "civilized" way) he can take your money in exchange for goods or a certain service, but then give you only a half of what was initially promised.
