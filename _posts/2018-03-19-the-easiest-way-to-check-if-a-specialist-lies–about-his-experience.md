The question is really simple: "Could you please recommend a book on your specialization?"

A scrum master should be able to name a book about the scrum methodology _immediately_. A Microservices Specialist — about microservices. A QA Engineer — about testing. I guess you've got my point. If a person says “Sam Newman, Microservices”, you have a chance that he is a specialist. If he says “I read articles on the internet” or “I read answers on StackOverflow” — beware of his lies.

### What If I Watch Video Lectures?

He may say "But reading books is too old-fashioned, I watch videos and attend online courses instead!" Bullshit, and here's why.

Let's start with videos. Believe it or not, their main purpose is entertainment. They fit well if you want to spend your free evening with a pack of chips and you are tired watching series or comedians. Being made for entertainment, they do not cover all the necessary parts of the technology. If they did, they would be boring.

As for the online courses, that's already better. But it is still difficult to imagine a specialist who learned only by online courses.

### What If I Read The Official Documentation?

If you read it from the beginning till the end, that's OK. But, based on my experience, that's rarely the case. Usually people use documentation in case of troubles when, by some reason, answers on StackOverflow do not help. So they read a small part, small enough to fix the issue, and forget what they've read right after the fix.

This is not enough for a specialist. A specialist should have the whole picture in mind. Snatching out pieces from the documentation does not give the idea about the technology (or methodology) in general.

I do understand it is not possible to remember all the little details. But it is definitely possible (and mandatory for a specialist) to have an index of the technology in mind. So that if a problem or a question appears, you know, if your technology can solve it, how, in general, it might be solved and all you need is to re-read the small part.

### To Summarize

And what do you think? Would you agree on such a way to measure the professionalism? How much books do you read about your specialization?
