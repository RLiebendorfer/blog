To check if a person is a specialist, you have to ask a really simple question: "Could you please recommend a book of your speciality?"

A Scrum Master should be able to name [a book about the Scrum methodology](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction-ebook/dp/B007P5N8D4/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521386327&sr=1-4&keywords=scrum) _immediately_. A Microservices Specialist — [about microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Microservices-Action-John-Carnell/dp/1617293989/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521386408&sr=1-5&keywords=microservices). A QA Engineer — [about testing](https://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Introduction-Software-Testing-ebook/dp/B01BCPXLHU/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521386486&sr=1-2&keywords=quality+assurance+testing). I guess you've got my point. If a person says “Sam Newman, [Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1491950358)”, you *have a chance* that he is a specialist. If he says “I read articles on the internet” or “I read answers on StackOverflow” — beware of his lies.

By the way, this approach is very useful if you have a lot of candidates to interview because it allows you to save quite much time.

So, the necessary part of being a specialist is _reading books about the speciality_.

### "Yes, But What If I Watch Video Lectures?"

You may say "But reading books is too old-fashioned, I watch videos about my specialization instead!" That does not count, and here's why.

Believe it or not, the main purpose of the videos is *entertainment*. They fit well if you want to spend your free evening with a pack of chips and you are tired watching series or comedians. Being made for entertainment, they do not cover all the necessary parts of the specialization deeply enough. If they did, they would be simply boring.

If you replaced reading books with watching entertaining videos, you cannot become a specialist.

### "Yes, But What If I Read The Official Documentation?"

If you read it from cover to cover, that's okay. But, based on my experience, that's rarely the case. Usually you fallback to reading documentation in case of troubles when, by some reason, answers on StackOverflow do not help. So you read a small part, small enough to fix the issue. Once the fix is in place, you forget what you've read.

Though this is better than watching videos, this is not enough if you call yourself a specialist. A specialist should have the whole picture in mind. Snatching out pieces from the documentation does not give the idea about all the aspects and possibilities of the technology (or methodology).

I do understand it is impossible to remember all the small details. But it is definitely possible (and mandatory for a specialist) to have an overall picture of the technology in mind. Such a picture is like an index or a table of contents of the technology. If you keep such "table of contents" in mind and a problem appears, you know, if your technology can solve it and how in general it might be solved. Then all you need is to re-read the small part to call to mind the details.

So, official documentation can replace books, but only if you read it from cover to cover. Snatching out pieces of information from time to time cannot make you a specialist.

### To Summarize

Reading books is an essential part of becoming a specialist. If a person claims he is a specialist and cannot name at least one book on the topic, he lies.

And what do you think? Would you agree on such a way to measure the professionalism? How much books do you read about your specialization?
