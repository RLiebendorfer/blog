Imagine you have a toothache. You went to a doctor who started curing it right after you arrived. Imagine you asked him "Doctor, just for me to understand, what is the reason of my toothache? What are you currently curing?" And he said very calmly “I don’t know.” What was your impression about this specialist? Will you visit him again in a similar situation? Or you will be willing to find someone else as soon as possible.

What is the worst think you, as a professional, can say? I don't know!
Use "I'll clarify" instead of "I don't know", and then clarify indeed. Alternatively you should say "That is not important."
«Never say “I don’t know””.

If you _really_ don't know, don't try to pretend that you do, don't waste everyone's time.



### To Summarize

It’s not a shame to not know. Bullshit! It _is_ a shame! Never say this at work.
 
It's not a shame to not know. It's a shame not to get know it.
