What is the worst think you, as a professional, can say? I don't know!
Use "I'll clarify" instead of "I don't know", and then clarify indeed. Alternatively you should say "That is not important."
«Never say “I don’t know””.

<img alt="You and Your Client" src="{{ site.url }}{{ page.image }}">

If you _really_ don't know, don't try to pretend that you do, don't waste everyone's time.

Doctor, just for me to understand, what is the reason of my toothache you are currently curing? And he says “I don’t know!”

### To Summarize

 It’s not a shame to not know. Bullshit! It _is_ a shame! Never say this at work.
 
 It's not a shame to not know. It's a shame not to get know it.
