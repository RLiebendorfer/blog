Imagine you have a toothache. You went to a dentist who began to treat it right after you arrived. Once the therapy continued for more than two hours, you started to worry. You took a chance to speak and asked "Doctor, just for me to know, what is the cause of my toothache? What are you curing for the pretty long time?" And he said very calmly “I don’t know. I just try this and that<sup>*</sup>, maybe something will work. Maybe not, I really don't know, mate.”

What was your impression about this specialist? Will you visit him again in a similar situation? Or you will be willing to run away and find someone else as soon as possible?

### Never Say This At Work

"I don't know"... I cannot count how much I've heard this phrase from different kinds of software development professionals, starting from junior developers and to the very serious god-level architects responsible for taking key technical decisions.

There's nothing wrong with the phrase itself. However, such a claim is an indicator of either incompetence or laziness. Or both. So **don't use it yourself**. And **don't accept it from others**.

Actually, there is also the third reason for "I don't know". Strictly speaking, sometimes it can be a polite response to a stupid or irrelevant question. But even in this case, instead of pretending that _you_ don't know the answer (that maybe doesn't even exist), it's always more constructive to point explicitly to the irrelevance of _the question_. More about this in a second.

### So What If The Question Is Stupid?

To clarify the terminology, let's call a question "stupid" when it is either irrelevant, or it is relevant, but one who asks is expected to know the answer himself, however didn't even do any _research_ before asking. He just decided that your time is less important than his and it is perfectly okay to distract you.

In this case, as I already mentioned above, instead of _pretending_ politely that you don't know, better to spend some time to explain what exactly is wrong with the question and express the hope that such questions will never be asked to you again.

Why is it bad to politely pretend? Because the asking person may don't even know that he is behaving in a non-productive way (e.g., does not want to concentrate on his job and distracts others). So why not to help him to understand his mistake? This small investment allows you to not have such situation with the same person in the future.

### But What If You Really Don't Know?

What if you are responsible for an answer (say, you are in the position to understand the area or to take the decision), but you don't know at the moment? In this case saying "I Don't Know" is even worse than in the previous.

I believe, you have to say that at the moment you don't have the answer, but _promise to respond_, say, in an hour. And don't talk nonsense. If you _really_ don't know, don't try to pretend that you do, don't waste everyone's time.

There is a Russian proverb that says "There is no shame in not knowing; the shame lies in not finding out." So just find out the answer by the deadline you set up for yourself.

### To Summarize

What is the worst thing you, as a professional, can say? "I don't know"! Forget this phase. Remove it from your lexicon. And please, if you once hear that I myself use this phrase, let me know.

If you are one who should know the answer (and you don't), use "I'll clarify" instead of "I don't know", and then clarify indeed. Alternatively (if someone asks something stupid) you should say "That is not important" or even "Try finding out the answer yourself before asking", but **never say "I don’t know"**.

<sup>*</sup> That's not bad to try this and that. Actually this approach works well. But you still have _to have at least a little understanding on what are you doing_. Otherwise you will most likely spend a lot of time and money, cause the damage to the system and still won't solve the problem.
