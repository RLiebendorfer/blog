Use "I'll clarify" instead of "I don't know", and then clarify indeed. Alternatively you should say "That is not important."
«Never say “I don’t know””.

If you _really_ don't know, don't try to pretend that you do, don't waste everyone's time.

Doctor, just for me to understand, what is the reason of my toothache you are currently curing? And he says “I don’t know!”
 It’s not a shame to not know. Bullshit! It IS a shame!
 Never say this at work.
