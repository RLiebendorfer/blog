Imagine you have a toothache. You went to a dentist who started curing it right after you arrived. Once the therapy continued for more than two hours, you started to worry. You took a chance to speak and asked "Doctor, just for me to know, what is the cause of my toothache? What are you curing for the pretty long time?" And he said very calmly “I don’t know. I just try this and that<sup>*</sup>, maybe something will work. Maybe not, I really don't know, mate.”

What was your impression about this specialist? Will you visit him again in a similar situation? Or you will be willing to run away and find someone else as soon as possible?

### Never Say This At Work

I cannot count how much I've heard this phrase from a different kind of software development professionals, starting from junior developers and to the very serious architects responsible for taking key technical decisions.

There's nothing wrong with the phrase itself. However, such a claim is an indicator of either incompetence or laziness. Or both.

Strictly speaking, sometimes it can be an indication of that a stupid or irrelevant question was just asked. I believe that instead of pretending that _you_ don't know an answer (that maybe doesn't even exist), it's always more constructive to point explicitly to its irrelevance. More about this in a second.

### So What If The Question Is Stupid?

To clarify the terminology, let's call a question "stupid" when it is either irrelevant, or it is relevant, but one who asks is expected to know the answer himself, however didn't even do any research before asking. He just decided that your time is less important than his and it is perfectly okay to distract you.

In this case, as I already mentioned above, instead of _pretending_ that you don't know, better to spend some time for explaining the situation and express the hope that it will never repeat.

Why is it bad to pretend? Because the asking person may even don't know that he is behaving in a non-productive way. So why to not help him to understand his mistake? This small investment allows you to not have such situation with the same person in the future.

### But What If You Really Don't Know?

What if you are responsible for an answer (you are expected to know this), but you don't know at the moment? In this case saying "I Don't Know" is even worse than in the previous.

I believe, you have to say that at the moment you don't have answer, but _promise to respond_, say, in an hour. And don't say stupid things. If you _really_ don't know, don't try to pretend that you do, don't waste everyone's time.

There is a Russian proverb that says "There is no shame in not knowing; the shame lies in not finding out." So just find out the answer by the deadline you set up for yourself.

### To Summarize

What is the worst think you, as a professional, can say? I don't know! If you've heard that I myself use this phrase, please let me know.

Use "I'll clarify" instead of "I don't know", and then clarify indeed. Alternatively you should say "That is not important." or even "Try finding out the answer yourself before asking.", but never say "I don’t know".

<sup>*</sup> That's not bad to try this and that, actually this approach works well. But you still have to have at least a little impression on what are you doing.
