Your employer hires you, pays for your working environment, corporate events and the table for playing tennis. Right? Not at all.

In fact, it's just the opposite. You hire your employer. Your employer in reality is a fancy platform for finding clients. You tell him "I can do this and that, could you please find someone who will pay me for this?" and he answers you "Okay, no problem. But not for free."

And you pay, you pay [really much](http://TODO-proof-link).

The payments are of course indirect. Your employer just filters out most of the money your clients transfer to _you_. He takes part of them as the fee for his service. The rest is spent for the ping-pong table, for your comfortable chair, for the fancy coffee machine in the kitchen and sometimes even for your free<sup>*</sup> lunches.

Imagine your favorite restaurant one day cooked you an awful breakfast. What do you do in this case? You kindly demand to replace it. What do you do if it happens again and again?  Right, you change the restaurant. You have every right to do this: you pay for the food really much and expect it to be of the best possible quality.

The same has to be with your employer: he finds clients for you. You work with him as long as he suits you. Once he stops suiting – you must explain the situation and ask him to make necessary changes. If he claims nothing can be done, you immediately change him to a better one. Nothing personal. Those who pay the piper call the tune.

Продуктовая компания – это тоже платформа для поиска клиентов. Просто клиентами являются подзазделения самой этой компании. А в остальном всё то же самое: платформа _за твои собственные деньги_ даёт тебе бесплатные обеды, кофе в офисе, теннисный стол и так далее.

Если ты хочешь покинуть ресторан, тебя не остановят мольбы шефа остаться. А тут почему-то останавливают?
Если ты открыто выказываешь недовольство, шеф тебя любить не будет. Но это лучше, чем травиться просроченным бургером.

### Summary

1. _You_ are one who pays. Don't be afraid to demand what you want.
2. Try to get rid of the platform and start looking for clients by yourself. You'll save _plenty_ of money.
