Your employer hires you, pays for your working environment, corporate events and the table for playing tennis. Right? Not at all.

<img alt="You and Your Employer" src="{{ site.url }}{{ page.image }}">

In fact, it's just the opposite. You hire your employer. Your employer in reality is a fancy platform for finding clients. You tell him "I can do this and that, could you please find someone who will pay me for this?" and he answers you "Okay, no problem. But not for free."

And you pay, you pay [really much](https://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/2641/is-outsourcing-exploitation/).

The payments are of course indirect. Your employer just filters out most of the money your clients transfer to _you_. He takes part of it as the fee for his service. The rest is spent for the ping-pong table, for your comfortable chair, for the fancy coffee machine in the kitchen and sometimes even for your free<sup>*</sup> lunches.

### What does it mean for you?

First, __don't feel guilty when you demand better conditions for yourself__.

Imagine your favorite restaurant one day cooked you an awful breakfast. What do you do in this case? You kindly demand to replace it. What do you do if it happens again? Right, you change the restaurant. You have every right to do this: you pay for the food and expect it to be of the best possible quality.

The same has to be with your employer: he finds clients for you. He is also responsible for your working environment. You collaborate with him as long as he suits you. Once he stops suiting – you must explain the situation and ask him to take the necessary actions. It could be replacing your old monitor with the new one or paying you more competitive salary. If he claims nothing can be done, you change him to a better one. Nothing personal. Those who pay the piper call the tune.

Second, __consider getting rid of the services of your employer__ at all. Find clients yourself.

It's easier said than done. However, I believe that you have at least try your hand at, say, freelancing. Your rates there are higher in particular [because there is no the filter](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-freelancers-paid-more-than-employees) that takes the most of your money.

### Looks like that was about an outsource company, how about a product one?

No big difference for you. A product company is also the platform to look for clients. But the "clients" are the company itself. Everything else is the same: the platform _for your own money_ gives you the job opportunity and the coffee.

### Summary

You hire your employer to look for clients for you. This means that:

1. _You_ are one who pays. Don't be afraid and don't hesitate to demand what you want.
2. You have to stop overpaying for the services of your employer and start looking for clients yourself. You'll save _plenty_ of money.

<sup>*</sup> Not free.
