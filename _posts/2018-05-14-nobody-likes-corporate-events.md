Team building is very useful for your career growth: it helps you build and maintain relations with your colleagues and your employer. It also improves your performance in a team-based environment. Right?

Not really. In reality, it is an enemy of your career. Let me explain why.

<img alt="Problem Solving" src="{{ site.url }}{{ page.image }}">

### You Are Just A Resource

Let's start with the harsh truth: you are not a person. Even not a human being. You are a money-making tool of your employer. Some employers even call you "a resource" and refer to you by your "resource ID", did you know about that?

### You Must Be Profitable

Being a tool for money-making, you must be profitable. If you are not profitable, you are fired. Nobody is going to coddle (?) with you.

What is the profitability? In a simple language, it is a difference between how much you earn for your employee and how much you cost for him.

Obviously, the bigger is your profitability the more chances you have to succeed as an employee. If it is close to zero or, god forbid, negative, you will be eventually fired. That's it. Everything is super-simple.

### Enemies Of Your Profitability

There is your profitability. It matters. And there is other stuff, for example, how many corporate trainings you attended, how many new joiners you coached and how awesome the brownbag presentations you gave were. They __do not matter at all__! Nobody cares, really.

I cannot give you a full list of these completely unimportant things, because it is really huge. Every employer has his own.

These things are not only _not helping_ you with your career. No. They are the enemies of it. Why? Because they take _a lot_ of your time and energy and, as a result, give you a false hope that your employer will notice your "efforts" and start paying you more money.

One of the most popular enemies of your career is team building.

### You Work Overtime Without Compensation There

Wake up. Your colleagues [are not your friends](https://chinmaeke.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/your-colleagues-are-not-your-friends/). Team building with them is not a party with your friends, therefore. You are still at work. You should be very careful with what you are doing, what you are saying and about whom you are saying it.

Participating in team buildings is your job. __Every job should be paid.__ If it is not paid, you should not even start it. When your employer forces you to participate in team buildings, you have to answer something like this, in a very polite way:

"Dear \<put the name of your employer here\>,

You pay me for 40 hours a week. I work for you these 40 hours. I don't waste a second on watching YouTube and PornHub, scrolling Facebook and discussing politics with my colleagues. I work like hell. Even when I'm drinking coffee, I keep thinking on how to make the code I've just written [more maintainable](https://govnokod.ru).

Now, why do you think I should spend even _a second_ of my personal time on things that are part of my work? Yes, I am speaking about the team buildings you force me to participate in. Even if they help me communicate more efficiently with my team, still, I'd prefer to solve my working problems _at work_. You are not paying me for doing this in my free time.

It is absolutely mandatory to join the events? No problem, if they are during working hours.

Oh, they are in the evening or on the weekend? Okay, but where is my overtime compensation then?

There is no compensation provided? Well, sorry, I don't think we can continue working together. I value my own time too much."

### You Drink There

I'm not a doctor to talk about the dangers of alcohol. All people are different. Alcohol turns some of them into stupid monkeys and eventually kills them. But, who knows, maybe it makes others really smart and healthy? I'm not to judge.

However, what I know for sure is that it's really bad idea to drink with your colleagues and, especially, with your boss.

When you are drunk, your start doing stupid things. I was a witness of such things quite often.

They can be relatively innocuous (like one my colleague who tore to shreds all the money from his wallet trying to prove that money do not matter). Sometimes, however, they can be really dangerous, at least for your reputation, not to speak about your life.

Do not want to tarnish your reputation? Stay away from team buildings.

### To Summarize

The article is not about you because you really like the corporate events? Please, leave a comment, I would like to know the reason why you _sincerely_ like them.
