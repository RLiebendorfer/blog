Corporate events are an important part of a healthy team spirit and great performance. People like them. People join them of mere motion. That is... complete nonsense!

Let's start with the harsh truth. You are not a person. Even not a human being. You are a money-making tool of your employer. Some employers even call you "a resource" and refer to you by your "resource ID", did you know about that?

Being a tool for money-making, you must be profitable. If you are not profitable, you are fired. Nobody is going to coddle with you.

Your employer lies to you.

You and your employer are in a conflict.

Corporate events are mandatory.

Most of the people do not like corporate events

Team building is procuration.

It does not matter if you are completely ignoring the events or you are visiting all of them. Even though in some organizations they are declared mandatory (usually offstage). Even though you may believe that by visiting them you are becoming "a better employee". Enough! You'll be fired anyway once you will stop being profitable.

They are not your friends (link to the book here). How many of them will go to your funeral? Nobody will even remember about you the next day.

Dear Employer,

You pay me for 40 hours a week. I work for you these 40 hours. I don't waste a second on watching YouTube (or PornHub), scrolling Facebook and discussing politics with my colleagues. I work like hell. Even when I'm drinking coffee, I keep thinking on how to make the code I've just written more maintainable.

Now, why do you think I should spend even _a second_ of my personal time on things that are part of my work? Yes, I am speaking about the corporate events you want me to participate in. Even if they help me communicate more efficiently with my team, still, I'd prefer to solve my working problems _at work_. You are not paying me for doing this in my free time.

You want me to join the events? No problem, if they are during working hours.

Ah, they are in the evening or on the weekend? Okay, but where is my overtime bonus then?

They are just mandatory and you don't want to pay? Well, sorry, I don't think we can continue working together.

By the way, I do meet my colleagues in my free time. I even date with some of them from time to time. But the difference is that in this case I decide _when_ to meet, _whom_ to join and _what_ to do. I am not 10 years old. Let _me_ decide.
