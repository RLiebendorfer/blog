Some two years ago, I did not even think about living Tallinn. Not because of the lack of opportunities for software developers. More because I could not imagine that there is such a great place for working as a programmer in 4 hours by car from my hometown Saint Petersburg.

Why do I think this place is great? Let me explain.

### People

Difficult to judge about people without scientific research, I am going to rely on my personal sensation here.

It seems to me that people here are very direct. If they like what you are doing they tell it right away. If they do not like, they criticize directly. Being a direct person myself, I do like this approach.

### Easy To Do Everyday Activities

Another reason why I think people do not like wasting time is because how quick and easy is to do common things here.

Electronic signature makes it possible to save time by signing documents online. No need to go to by person and put an analog signature on a paper. You can even start your own company without leaving your apartment.

Public transport goes strictly by schedule, covers pretty much all the places and is free for ones who have Tallinn registration. The size of the city, however, often allows you to go by foot, everything is really close to each other.

Due to the small amount of people in the city, the traffic jam is not huge even in a rush hour. Physical queues are also a rare thing here.

If you are a dog owner, the dog walking grounds are everywhere.

### Ecology And Crime

The air is clean. It is especially noticeable after spending a weekend in Saint Petersburg. It is not only my subjective feeling, [the numbers](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Estonia&country2=Russia&city1=Tallinn&city2=Saint+Petersburg) say the same.

Tallinn is green. It is full of parks, while itself is surrounded by forests. Even living next to the city center, you easily can see a hare hiding in bushes. From some people I also heard about foxes and deers, it was, however already closer to the outskirts of the city.

"Kraanivesi on joogivesi!" was the first thing I have heard about the local tape water. Indeed, the tape water is completely fine and [safe for drinking](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g274958-i996-k5879936-Is_tap_water_safe_to_drink_in_Tallinn-Tallinn_Harju_County.html).

Crime level is [relatively low](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Estonia&country2=Russia&city1=Tallinn&city2=Saint+Petersburg). This of course does not mean robbery and murder do not happen (open any local news website). Still, chances of being robbed or killed on a street, get your car stolen or your apartment robbed are low.

### IT World

Estonia has built [attractive conditions for IT companies](https://medium.com/swlh/the-new-silicon-valley-tallinn-estonia-83e0f06fd20f). As a result, the number of the companies has grown high. High number of the IT companies entails high demand for software developers. The number of developers currently available on the labor market is too small to fulfil the demand. As a result, the salaries are high, the number of job opportunities is big, the potential employers are open for communication if you want to agree on better conditions for yourself.

### To Summarize

Next time let's discuss the downsides of Tallinn.
