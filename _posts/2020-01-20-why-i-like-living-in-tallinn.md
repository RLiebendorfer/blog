Some two years ago, I did not even think about living Tallinn. Not because of the lack of opportunities for software developers. More because I could not imagine that there is such a great place for working as a programmer in 4 hours by car from my hometown Saint Petersburg.

Why do I think this place is great? Let me explain.

### People

Difficult to judge about people without scientific research, I am going to rely on my personal sensation here.

It seems to me that people here are very direct. If they like what you are doing they tell it right away. If they do not like, they criticize directly. I like this approach.

### Ecology And Crime

The air is clean. It is especially noticeable after spending a weekend in Saint Petersburg. It is not only my subjective feeling, [the numbers](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Estonia&country2=Russia&city1=Tallinn&city2=Saint+Petersburg) say the same.

Tallinn is green. There are a lot of parks inside the town, while the town itself is surrounded by forests. Even living next to the city center, you easily can see a hare hiding in bushes. From some people I also heard about foxes and deers.

### IT World

Estonia has built quite attractive conditions for IT companies. As a result, the number of the companies has grown high. High number of the IT companies means high demand for software developers. The developers currently available on the labor market cannot fulfil the demand. As a result, the salaries are high, the number of job opportunities is big, the potential employers are open to communication if you want to agree on better conditions for yourself.

### To Summarize

Next time let's discuss the downsides of Tallinn.
