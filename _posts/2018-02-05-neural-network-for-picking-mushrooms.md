Imagine yourself in a forest picking mushrooms (just for fun or, probably, not to starve to death). How do you decide if a mushroom is edible or poisonous? Is there a way to utilize a neural network to help you with the decision? And, finally, can you come up with a simpler, but more efficient solution? Let's figure it out!

This is the most naive way to evaluate a model. It has a lot of disadvantages. For example it does not pay attention to the proportion of the classes in the test data. However because of its simplicity it can be used for illustration purposes.

### Artificial Neural Network

### K Nearest Neighbours

Now let's compare our neural network with another model, for example with k nearest neighbours.

### To Summarize

Next time when I will go to a forest, I will test the model on the real data. It does not work in 100% of cases. However, that is natural: if there is a model that covers 100% cases, it is a sign that most likely something went wrong.
