Speaking abstractly, there are many ways of how an unscrupulous person can steal your money. He can just pick up your wallet. This is the most straight yet dangerous way. Alternatively, he can silently pull the wallet out of your pocket. Already better, though still dangerous. Or he can take your money in exchange for goods or a certain service, but then give you only a half of what he initially promised. This is the safest and the most civilized option. So, _lower result for the same money is stealing_.

The really bad news are that with the last way _even you can_ steal. Even worse: you may do it unconsciously and even not of your own free will.

### Your Client Pays You For Your Time<sup>*</sup>

To agree the terminology, [your client is not the same as your employer]({{ site.url }}/2018/01/08/who-pays-for-your-coffee). The former hires you and gives you the laptop and the coffee. The latter consumes your software development services and pays you money. The employer finds the clients for you. In return, you share some part of your income with your employer. This is true for the outsource companies. This is also true (though not that obvious) for the product-based companies.

Let's assume you work for your client for 40 hours a week and your hourly rate is 20 $. This means that you charge your client 800 $ a week. Sometimes you do it _explicitly_ by putting your hours to the Excel tables or to the form on the ugly corporate web site<sup>**</sup>. In return, the client expects you to spend these 40 hours solving _his_ problems.

### But Your Employer Makes You Spend That Time On Non-Working Stuff

Unfortunately, your employer has his own plans on you. Because of these plans, you work for your client only for about 36 hours a week, though you were paid for 40. How do you spend the rest four hours? Here are the possible options:

1. Attendance of the super important corporate trainings
2. Preparation of these trainings
3. Passing mandatory psychological tests
4. Quiz preparation to select candidates for the ongoing QA school
5. Helping new employees to become the part of the company. Of course, on a regular basis, as your employer hires really much
6. Internal certification
7. Mandatory monthly meetings about the recent structural changes in your company

Does anything from the list solve the issues of your client, ones he paid you to solve? Do they make the product of your client better and more attractive for the users? Absolutely not.

### Your Employer Makes You Steal

As a result of the sad things discussed above, __you steal money from your client__. And, surprisingly, your employer makes you do so. Even _without realizing_ this. Even _without wanting_ this. But just __by distracting you from your main responsibilities__. In the long run, not only the product of your client is worse than it could be, but also much of your time is wasted on the things that don't make you the better specialist, on the things that are not interesting for you _at all_.

### Possible Solutions

Now let's see how you can prevent this from happening. Though the list has three items, there are only two real solutions.

1. (Not a solution for _you_.) Do the non-working stuff on your free time. That's usually how your employer wants you to "solve" the problem. As for me, __that's not an option__. I have my personal life, as well as my pet projects and my blog. I have a lot of much more interesting things than the mandatory psychological tests and the meetings. I believe that is the case for you as well.
2. Overtime. Charge your employer for the additional 4 hours a week. In this case, at least, you are not doing the dull stuff for free.
3. Charge your client only for the 36 hours. Charge your employer for the rest 4 hours.

Did I miss something else?

### To Summarize

In the threesome "You, Your Employer, Your Client" namely your client is the most important part. He pays you. In return, you do your best to provide him with the best possible solution. Your employer distracts you from that. You should be ready to minimize the distraction. If you charge for 40 hours, work for the 40 hours, not for the 36.

<sup>*</sup> That's not _always_ the case. Still, it is a common practice in the software development.

<sup>**</sup> Those, you know, that work only in Internet Explorer.
