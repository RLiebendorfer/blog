### Lower Result For The Same Money Is Stealing

There is a number of ways how someone can steal your money. He can just pick up your wallet. This is the most straight yet dangerous way. Alternatively, he can silently pull the wallet out of your pocket. Already better, though still dangerous. Or he can take your money in exchange for goods or a certain service, but then give you only a half of what was initially promised. This is the safest and the most civilized option. To summarize the paragraph: lower result for the same money _is_ stealing.

### Your Client Pays You For 40 Hours A Week<sup>*</sup>

First of all, [your client is not the same as your employer]({{ site.url }}/2018/01/08/who-pays-for-your-coffee). The former hires you and gives you the laptop and the coffee. The latter consumes your software development services and pays you money. The employer finds the client for you. In return, you share some part of your income with your employer. This is true for the outsource companies. This is also true (though less obvious) for the product-based companies.

In some cases you even charge him explicitly by filling some Excels or ugly forms on ugly corporate web sites<sup>**</sup> with the amount of hours you spent working for him.
