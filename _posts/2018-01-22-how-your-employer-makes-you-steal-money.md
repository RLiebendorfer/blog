### Lower Result For The Same Money Is Stealing

Let's start from the not very bright theory. There is a number of ways how someone can steal your money. One can just pick up your wallet. This is the most straight yet dangerous way. Alternatively, one can silently pull the wallet out of your pocket. Already better, though still dangerous. Or one can take your money in exchange for goods or a certain service, but then give you only a half of what was initially promised. This is the safest and the most civilized option. To summarize the paragraph: lower result for the same money _is stealing_.

### Your Client Pays You For Your Time<sup>*</sup>

To agree the terminology, [your client is not the same as your employer]({{ site.url }}/2018/01/08/who-pays-for-your-coffee). The former hires you and gives you the laptop and the coffee. The latter consumes your software development services and pays you money. The employer finds the clients for you. In return, you share some part of your income with your employer. This is true for the outsource companies. This is also true (though not that obvious) for the product-based companies.

Let's assume you are working 40 hours a week and your hourly rate is 20$. Your client pays you 800$ a week and expects you to work for 40 hours on solving _his_ problems. In some cases you even charge him explicitly by filling some excels or the forms on the ugly corporate web sites<sup>**</sup> with the amount of hours you spent working _for him_.

### Your Employer Makes You Spend That Time On Non-Working Stuff

Because of your employer, you work only about 36 hours even being paid for 40. How do you spend the missing four hours? Here are the possible options:

1. Corporate trainings attendance
2. Preparation of the corporate trainings
3. Mandatory Psychological tests
4. Quiz preparation to select candidates for the ongoing QA school
5. Preparing the internal presentation about ethics
6. Helping new employees to become the part of the company, on a regular basis
7. Internal certification
8. Mandatory monthly meetings about the recent structural changes in your company

Does any of them solve the issues of your client, ones he paid you to solve? Do they make the product of your client better and more attractive for users? Absolutely not.

### Your Employer Makes You Steal

I think at that point you already know why this is the case. Now let's see how we can prevent this from happening.

### Possible Solutions

1. Do the non-working stuff on your free time. That's usually how your employer wants you to "solve" the problem. As for me, __that's not an option__. I have my personal life, as well as my pet projects and my blog. I have a lot of much more interesting things than the mandatory psychological tests and the meetings. I believe that is the case for you as well.
2. Overtime. Charge your employer for the additional 4 hours a week.
3. Charge your client only for the 36 hours. Charge your employer for the rest 4 hours.

### To Summarize

The client is the god. He pays you. In return, you do your best to provide him with the best possible solution. The employer destructs you from that. You should be ready to minimize the destruction. If you charge for 40 hours, work 40 hours, not 36.

<sup>*</sup> That's not _always_ the case, yet a common practice in the software development.

<sup>**</sup> Those, you know, that work only in Internet Explorer.
