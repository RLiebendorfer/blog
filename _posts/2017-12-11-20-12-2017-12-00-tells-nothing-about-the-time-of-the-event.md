The event happened `20.**.2017 12:00`. Can you tell me, when exactly? Not really, because something is missed? How about `20.12.2017 12:00`? If you think that now you can, you are wrong. You still do not know the exact time of the event. However, the missing part is much less obvious now.

### The UTC offset is as much important as the day, month, year, hour, etc.

Returning to our example, only `20.12.2017 12:00 UTC+03:00` gives you enough information about when the event happened. But are you sure you always remember about the `UTC+03:00` part?

### Time zone also suits

Not necessarily the UTC offset should be given to you. Time zone also fills the gap, as it keeps the offset information. So `20.12.2017 12:00 Europe/Moscow` would be also perfectly OK.
