"Let's discuss!"

Try to watch your brain while solving a complex task. This little bustard always tries to dodge the problem solving, to switch to less actual or completely irrelevant things at the moment.

It is a lazy beast!

### Real Life Example

This is even easier to observe during brainstorming (mistakenly called "discussion" by stupid managers).

### Plan

Your brain always tries to go aside. Don't let him do it! One of the approach is to utilize a plan.

You will save much time: often happens that the plan sucks. You better understand it as soon as possible and develop a better plan instead of wasting half a day for the futile job.

### To Summarize

First plan then act. Don't allow your brain to fool you. Always pay attention to what's is it doing and put it back on track if it tries to slip off.
