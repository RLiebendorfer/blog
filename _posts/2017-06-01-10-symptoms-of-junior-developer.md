### How to determine a junior developer by their code

1. Has a phobia of new methods creation (prefers to increase the size of existing methods turning them into unsupportable 500-lines-of-code mess). Believes that introducing of new method noticeably reduces performance
2. Has a phobia of new classes creation (prefers to increase the size of existing classes turning them into unsupportable 8000-lines-of-code mess). Believes that introducing of new class noticeably reduces performance
3. Prefers comments to self-explanatory names for variables, methods, classes etc.
4. Passes data between methods using mutable class fields
5. Invents over-engineered solutions. And then genuinely defends them as if they were their own children 
6. Does not use ready solutions, writes their own instead
7. Never writes unit tests. If nevertheless does, uses hacky tools like Mockito or PowerMock.
8. Never uses checked exceptions. Does not understand why and when are they needed.
9. Never uses interfaces
10. Never uses static imports
11. Does not embed new functionality into current code, instead puts it as much "aside" as possible, causing code duplicates and mess
12. Sincerely convinced that "final" is an excessive keyword, never uses it.
