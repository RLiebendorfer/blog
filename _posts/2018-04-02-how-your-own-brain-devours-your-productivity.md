Try to watch your brain while thinking through a solution of a complex problem. Do you notice that this little rogue always tries to dodge the problem solving, to switch to less actual or completely irrelevant at the moment things?

Why exactly does it behaves in this way is a question to biologists. Most likely it is striving to save energy.

Let's try to figure out how we can still be on track and do not allow our brain to switch to irrelevant stuff.

### "Let's Discuss"

This happens even more often when you are not alone brainstorming a problem. Obviously, the more "brains" participate the brainstorming, to bigger is the probability for this to happen.

Imagine that you and your coworker are solving a tricky issue with a stored procedure performance.

You started well, you even found out that the performance depends very much on if a certain parameter was bigger or smaller than a certain threshold value. You started to have an impression that you were already close to the root cause...

And then your colleague says "By the way, I don't like the stored procedure name, do you? It does not reflect its behavior."  And in a minute you are already not solving the issue, you are speaking about naming conventions in general, your personal naming preferences and how you used to name things in your previous project. And after some time you feel tired and decide to go grab some coffee.

As a result, you _discussed_ the performance issue. You also _discussed_ the naming standards. But you _didn't solve_ any of these issues. This is the classics.

This is the classics. You started with the brainstorming. You finished discussing irrelevant things.

### Plan

Your brain always tries to go aside. Don't let him do it! One of the approach is to utilize a plan.

You will save much time: often happens that the plan sucks. You better understand it as soon as possible and develop a better plan instead of wasting half a day for the futile job.

### To Summarize

First plan then act. Don't allow your brain to fool you. Always pay attention to what's is it doing and put it back on track if it tries to slip off.
